Inheritance :- 
    1.Inheritance allows child class(derived class) to reuse the properties and method of parent class(base class).
    2.Instead of rewrinting the same code in multiple palces we allow child class to reuse the parent properties and methods.

Types of Inheritance:-
1.Single Inheritance
2.Muli-level Inheritance
3.Hierarchical Inheritance
4.Multiple Inheritance (not suppored by java but we can achive this by interface)

1.Single Inheritance
Benefits :- 1) reusability 2) maintainability 3)scalability

* syntax of Single Inheritance :-

    class parent {
        // properties and methods
    }
    class child extends parent {
        // additional properties and methods
    }

2.Muli-level Inheritance:-
