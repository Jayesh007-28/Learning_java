Class:-
1. Class is blueprint of object
2. Class is collection of variable,objects,methods.
3. Class Consist of state and behavior of object.
4. Class doesn't occupy the memory until the object is created.
5. And object cannot exsist without class but class can exsist without any object.
6. Class name always start with uppercase.
Ex:- Think of class is a recipie and object is a actual thing that is crated using that recipie book.

Syntax of Class:-
   access_modifier Class className{
        state,
        behavior / methods
   }

objects:-
1.Object is instance of class that has state and behavior.
2.Object always occupy memory
3.Object is a runtime entity.

Syntax of object:-
    className objName = new className();
    

Bike:-
1:- state : color,speed,brand name
2:- behavior :- strat,stop,moving,break,accelrate

Bnak
1:- state : Account Number ,Account Holder Name
2:- behavior :- deposit, withdraw,checkBalance,transferMoney

Methods:-
Defination :- A block of code that perform specfic task or work
Advantages:- Code become modular, it provide reusability, it's easy read , debug , maintaince  [using method]
Disadvantages :- Code become lengthy , increase complexity , hard to maintain [without method]

Syntax of method :- 
    access_modifier returnType methodName(){
        //block of code
    }

Types of methods :-Method with no return Types
    1.Method with no return Types
    2.Method with return parameter
    3.Method with parameter
    4.Method with no parameter
    5.Static method
    6.Instance method

1.Method with no return Types :-
    Defination :- A method that does not return any value

    Syntax:-
        access_modifier void methodName(){
            //block of code
        }

2.Method with return parameter:-
    Defination:- A method that return a value to the caller(main methos)
    Syntax:-
        access_modifier returnType methodName(){
            //block of code
        }
    
3.Method with parameter:-
    Defination:- A method that accept input values.
    Syntax:-
        access_modifier returnType methodName(parameters){
            //block of code
        }

4.Method with no parameter:-
    Defination:-A method does not take any input

5.Static method:-
    Defination:-A method that belong to the class not to the object
    

6.Instance method:-
     Defination:-

Q.Why main method is always static?
Ans -> 1.The jvm calls main method without creating any object so its always static.
       2.In satic is does create any object.

*Static keyword:-
Theory :- 1.When we put satic in front of something (variable,method,class) it means this things belongs to class not to the any object
    2.It will have a only one copy in the memory , only one copy to the members exsist in amemory regardless of how many object of the class you create  
    3.we access without creating object using className.memberNames
